    "### Who are we?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dr. Taryn Scharf (Postdoctoral Researcher - Curtin)\n",
    "I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group, Curtin University (https://research.curtin.edu.au/scieng/research/timescales-of-mineral-systems/). I am involved in developing computational tools that can be integrated with standard geological approaches for mineral analysis. My toolkit includes machine learning (tabular and image data sets), data analytics, and a variety of coding languages. Python is my preferred programming language for scientific data analysis.  I completed my PhD in Applied Geoscience in 2024 at Curtin University. Prior to my PhD, I spent 7 years as a geologist in the mining industry of South Africa. I was initially involved with brown fields exploration, geostatistical resource estimation, and the development of custom scripted solutions for clients. I later gained exposure to mine design, mine scheduling, and requirements analysis for software development.\n",

    "#### Dr. Ben Knight (Postdoctoral Researcher - Curtin)\n",
    "I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Laboratory for Lithosphere Evolution and Geodynamics group (https://uhthp.com/). My current research spans multiple scales, aiming to link micro (mineral) and macro (plate) scale processes to unravel the deep-time evolution of Earth's crust and lithosphere through numerical modelling. I was first introduced to numerical modelling during a year abroad at Stockholm University, which led me to focus on modelling incipient subduction for my thesis back in Cardiff. This resulted in moving to Melbourne for my PhD at Monash University, where I used numerical modelling to investigate the geodynamic evolution of the Himalayas and Southern Tibet, exploring the forces that have shaped the region. After my PhD I collaborated with Geoscience Australia to study groundwater flow in the Great Artesian Basin, applying a Bayesian modelling approach to integrate lithology, structural data, and hydrological measurements (hydraulic head, recharge rates) to better understand large-scale groundwater flow across the basin. I am currently working on modelling diffusion-decay-ingrowth at the mineral scale, as well as large-scale models of continental collision, to better understand the amalgamation of Gondwana. \n",

    "#### Dr. Luc Doucet (Senior Research Fellow - Curtin)\n",
    "Co-leader of the Earth Dynamics Research Group (http://geodynamics.curtin.edu.au/), I come from Bourg-en-Bresse, a small town in France famously known for its blue-white-red tricoloured (delicious) chickens. After a PhD in St Etienne, France (2012), I was awarded a three years fellowship from the Belgium Fund for Scientific Research to apply the \"non-traditional\" stable-isotope systematics to study the formation of both oceanic and continental lithosphere. After a two-year academic career break (being a stay-at-home dad), I moved to Curtin University in March 2018 to join the Earth Dynamics Research Group to decipher the present-day and past connections between Earth's mantle, supercontinent and superocean cycles. In 2023, I was awarded an ARC Future Fellowship to study the link between the deep carbon cycle with critical mineral deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Piero Sampaio (PhD Student - Curtin)\n",
    "I did my undergraduate and MSc. in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), where I was born and raised. My research is in geochemistry and igneous petrology, more specifically, I use isotopic signatures from ophiolites to try to understand how Earth's mantle composition evolved since the Neoproterozoic. I use Python on a daily basis to process my data, perform advanced data analysis and generate good-looking visuals.\n",

    "We'll be using Python notehooks to introduce you to the wonderful world of coding. Notebooks are handy ways to run short bits of code (in this case Python) and view results, without having to run a full program or script. This is ideal for practicing short examples or performing small pieces of analytics.\n",

For instance, the Pandas library simplifies data manipulation and analysis through its powerful data structures, the Matplotlib library enables high-quality data visualization and numpy for numerical calculations. These libraries expand Python's capabilities dramatically, allowing developers to leverage pre-built solutions and focus more on problem-solving rather than reinventing the wheel.\n",

This is great, because loops are very inefficient in terms of speed. It might not be vital for short tasks, but it scales very quickly."

    "- Python modules  have documentation and tutorials online. There are important resources when you need to understand the specifics of any command you are running.\n",

However, if your company allows, it's a valuable tool to save you time and help you learn. Remember not to put **sensitive information** into the model, as inputs are used for training the model further. \n",
