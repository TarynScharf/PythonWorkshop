# Welcome to the GSA-WA Python for geoscientists workshop!
The workshop will be led by Piero Sampaio, Luc Doucet and Taryn Scharf. To launch any notebook in an interactive way you only need to change the url (address) before the domain from `github` to `githubtocolab` (e.g. `github.com/pierosampaio/Pythonworkshop...` becomes
`githubtocolab.com/pierosampaio/PythonWorkshop...`)
